MoTextPy
========

Usage
=====

This is a simple `Cinema 4D <http://www.maxon.net/>`_ python script that is meant to be used on a
python tag. Just add a python tag to your MoText object and paste the script into the code field
of the tag. You can then save the tag as a preset or save the MoText object with the tag as a default.

Description
===========

There is really nothing to this script. The script just links together a few of the
Motext object's parameters. Specifically, the text field is linked to the MoText object name,
the star cap to the end cap, the start steps to the end steps, and start radius to the end radius.
